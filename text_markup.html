    <pre>O were my <b>love</b> yon Lilac fair,  
        Wi' purple blossoms to the Spring,
      And I, a bird to shelter there,  
        When wearied on my <strong>little</strong> wing!
      How I wad mourn when it was torn         
        By Autumn wild, and Winter rude!
      But I wad sing on wanton wing,  
        When <i>youthfu'</i> May its bloom renew'd. 
      O gin my love were yon red rose,  
        That grows upon the castle wa';    
      And I myself a drap o' dew,  
        Into her bonie breast to fa'!
      O there, beyond expression blest,  
        I'd <em>feast</em> on beauty a' the night;
      Seal'd on her silk-saft faulds to rest,
        Till fley'd awa by <u>Phoebus'</u> light!</pre>

      <br />

      H<sub>2</sub>O
